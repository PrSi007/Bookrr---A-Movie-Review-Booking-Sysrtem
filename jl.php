                <p class="review__description">We waited for this movie for 3.5 years and it was really worth the wait. Every character played their role well and Superman was Awesome. I didn't want it to end after the 4 hours. The thrill and experience is epic. Loved it from start to finish. Zack Snyder is a Genius!</p>

                <p class="review__description">Justice league snider cut- Review- Take my opinion with a grain of salt as I am a marvel Fan however, this movie as a whole is a team-up movie however as parts it tells many smaller stories in form of episodes fitting in Fluent, flowing, storytelling with energetic purposeful action sequences. allowing for not only epic origin stories of some characters we have been waiting for but also retcon a few holes in previously finished stories. it is difficult to find a way to connect to your audience for 4hrs, That is made much more difficult with SUPER HUMAN characters, The storytellers at DC and Zack Snyder did a fantastic job of Humanizing these heroes showing weakness, and allowing for character growth arch that left me in awe. the final battle and following scenes deliver everything we were looking for leading into this movie and as a whole Zack Snyder Has done his fan base a huge justice With this movie. it is Truly in a Leauge of its own.</p>

                <p class="review__description">Zack Snyder’s Justice League is, simply put, an absolute brilliant film. The pacing, action, acting, cinematography/visuals, and score are all top notch. While the 4-hour runtime may at first seem daunting to take on, the film actually moves along in a way that feels more like a 2 1/2-hour movie. This is a beautiful testament to Snyder using every bit of that time to masterfully build the story & character arcs in a way that feels entirely earned. </p>

                <p class="review__description">Regardless of whether you enjoy Snyder's darker, more morbid take on DC superheroes, there's no denying his 4-hour (!) cut of "Justice League" is a solid, all-engrossing picture</p>

                <p class="review__description">No matter the fanbase that surrounds the film, this film is for Zack Snyder and he deserves all the praise he can get.	It’s bloodier. More profane. Its quasi-spirituality can be perplexing. And then there’s this: It’s just a darker movie</p>

                <p class="review__description">Zack Snyder's Justice League lives up to its title with a sprawling cut that expands to fit the director's vision -- and should satisfy the fans who willed it into existence.With more action, more character development, and double the runtime, this is the epic Justice League that Zack Snyder fans have been asking for.</p>
