                <p class="review__description">I love Spider Man Far from Home. Almost throughout the whole movie is amazing. The reason why i love this movie is because it has a huge amount of action and fun parts to watch and see. The action is so good and the effects and editing is so unbelievable. The story is so gosh darn cool and great. This movie might be better than any other of the action films i have ever seen. So far this is the best spider-man movie i have ever watched. 10/10 Amazing Movie Might Watch Again.</p>

                <p class="review__description">ÔÉ®	I can not count the amount of times i have rewatched this amazing, thrilling and exciting movie. I'll estimate it to about 16 times if not more and before the third one comes out i am very sure i would have watched it about 63 times.
                  The movie is perfect no matter what type of movies you like. It has romance, comedy, action and even mystery with all the twists and turns. Never seen a movie better than this one .

                <p class="review__description">Spider Man Far From Home, starring Tom Holland and Zendaya,  is a light and breezy watch. Consider it as a break after the emotional intensity of Avengers Endgame.</p>

                <p class="review__description">ÔÉ®	Spider-Man: Far From Home is relatively lighthearted and breezy even; a far cry from the intense stakes of most of the other films in the Avengers franchise.</p>
