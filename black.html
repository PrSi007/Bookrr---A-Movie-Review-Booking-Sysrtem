                <p class="review__description">Like all the others here who write reviews, I'm supes excited too!! I like black widow because she's one of the few women who come out in the MCU and I'm a girl too. I like to believe that her powers come from her inside, like her heart. So I am so curious about what her own story would be like. You know, like how we can see her as a main character, not a side character.</p>

                <p class="review__description">The trailer is so superb. I feel like this movie has some kind of story. I'm really excited to watch this movie. Black widow is my favourite character in the MCU and now she is finally getting her own movie. I guess she's the most fierce fighter because she doesn't need any superhero serum to fight. She's a normal human with some superhuman strength and that's what gets me excited to watch this movie.</p>

                <p class="review__description">I breathe Marvel, and I cant wait to hear about Natasha Romanoff's backstory. She's always been with Fury and the avengers since the beginning. She doesn't even need superpowers, she just uses her pure skill. I cant wait!! We'll finally know what happened in Budapest!!!</p>

                <p class="review__description">Can’t wait! I’m a huge marvel fan like I’ve watched every show and movie, but black widow is definitely the best. She doesn’t need a super power to be amazing she already is.</p>

                <p class="review__description">She’s obviously the best fighter by far but also...she’s the one who took over the avengers in Endgame when nobody found themselves too be able to. She found a family and died saving it! But don’t forget she’s also just like generally super cool and like cool! Love her!!! Can’t wait to watch this movie!</p>
