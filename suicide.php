                <p class="review__description">I really enjoyed this movie.  I was initially turned off by all the negative reviews, but decided to finally watch it.  Great Cast, and highly enjoyable story.  I don't understand all the negative reviews from people.  I think a lot of people get upset when movies are not exactly how they would have like them to be.  Just shut up, sit back, and enjoy the show for what it is.  Life is easier this way.  Any ways, great movie.  Looking forward to Bird of Prey next :)</p>

                <p class="review__description">I loved this movie, Margot Robbie was great. But I really wish joker got more screen time. Unpopular opinion but Jared Leto was one of my favorite jokers. His acting was so good I loved how he showed all the sides of joker. And I loved his connection with Harley. He was able to slay the role of joker while still caring for Harley. They should not have fired him, that why I don't want to watch birds of prey but I'm sure Margot was fantastic.</p>

                <p class="review__description">I really loved this movie so damn much. All the casts were so amazing and I'm truly in love with JOKER AND HARLEY QUINN  ❤. I don't know why people not liking this movie much but all i can say that you should watch it and then decide. I had a fun time. So you'll too. </p>

                <p class="review__description">As I hope I have made apparent, the storytelling that brings all these characters together so quickly is lazy to the point of professional negligence.</p>

                <p class="review__description">While it's not quite as grim as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, it's even more problematic, and it's certainly not the tonic that Warner Bros. hoped it would be</p>
